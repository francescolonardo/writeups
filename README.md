# CTF Penetration Testing Writeups

This repository contains writeups of machines Iâ€™ve completed on CTF platforms like HackTheBox, HackMyVM, and VulNyx. Each writeup covers the attack techniques used, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the solutions applied to overcome the challenges. These writeups not only document my progress in penetration testing, but also serve as a resource for anyone interested in learning more about offensive security.

Sharing these writeups allows me to improve my skills while contributing to the community by providing insights into my approach to different problems. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, I hope these solutions offer value. The repository includes detailed steps for identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and achieving privilege escalation or post-exploitation when applicable.
