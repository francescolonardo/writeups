# CTF Penetration Testing Writeups

This repository contains writeups of machines Iâ€™ve completed on CTF platforms like HackTheBox, HackMyVM, and VulNyx. Each writeup covers the attack techniques used, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the solutions applied to overcome the challenges. The writeups are designed to provide a clear understanding of each step, including both the input commands and their corresponding output. This allows readers to follow along without needing to launch the virtual machine or run the commands themselves.

By sharing these writeups, I hope to improve my skills while contributing to the community by providing insights into my approach to different problems. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, I hope these solutions offer value. The repository includes detailed steps for identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and achieving privilege escalation or post-exploitation when applicable.
