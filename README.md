# CTF Penetration Testing Writeups

This repository contains writeups of machines Iâ€™ve completed on CTF platforms like **HackTheBox**, **HackMyVM**, and **VulNyx**. It includes detailed steps for identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and achieving privilege escalation or post-exploitation when applicable.

The writeups are designed to provide a clear understanding of each step, including both the *input commands* and their corresponding *output*. This allows readers to follow along without needing to launch the virtual machine or run the commands themselves.

By sharing these writeups, I hope to improve my skills while contributing to the community by providing insights into my approach to different problems. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, I hope these solutions offer value.
