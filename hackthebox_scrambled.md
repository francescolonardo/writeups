> Scrambled is a medium Windows Active Directory machine. Enumerating the website hosted on the remote machine a potential attacker is able to deduce the credentials for the user `ksimpson`. On the website, it is also stated that NTLM authentication is disabled meaning that Kerberos authentication is to be used. Accessing the `Public` share with the credentials of `ksimpson`, a PDF file states that an attacker retrieved the credentials of an SQL database. This is a hint that there is an SQL service running on the remote machine. Enumerating the normal user accounts, it is found that the account `SqlSvc` has a Service Principal Name (SPN) associated with it. An attacker can use this information to perform an attack that is knows as kerberoasting and get the hash of `SqlSvc`. After cracking the hash and acquiring the credentials for the `SqlSvc` account an attacker can perform a silver ticket attack to forge a ticket and impersonate the user `Administrator` on the remote MSSQL service. Enumeration of the database reveals the credentials for user `MiscSvc`, which can be used to execute code on the remote machine using PowerShell remoting. System enumeration as the new user reveals a .NET application, which is listening on port 4411. Reverse engineering the application reveals that it is using the insecure `Binary Formatter` class to transmit data, allowing the attacker to upload their own payload and get code execution as `nt authority\system`.
