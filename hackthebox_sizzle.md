> Sizzle is an insane difficulty Windows box with an Active Directory environment. A writable directory in an SMB share allows to steal NTLM hashes which can be cracked to access the Certificate Services Portal. A self signed certificate can be created using the CA and used for PSRemoting. A SPN associated with a user allows a kerberoast attack on the box. The user is found to have Replication rights which can be abused to get Administrator hashes via DCSync.
