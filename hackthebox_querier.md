> Querier is a medium difficulty Windows box which has an Excel spreadsheet in a world-readable file share. The spreadsheet has macros, which connect to MSSQL server running on the box. The SQL server can be used to request a file through which NetNTLMv2 hashes can be leaked and cracked to recover the plaintext password. After logging in, `PowerUp` can be used to find Administrator credentials in a locally cached group policy file.
