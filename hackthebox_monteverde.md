> Monteverde is a Medium Windows machine that features Azure AD Connect. The domain is enumerated and a user list is created. Through password spraying, the `SABatchJobs` service account is found to have the username as a password. Using this service account, it is possible to enumerate SMB Shares on the system, and the `$users` share is found to be world-readable. An XML file used for an Azure AD account is found within a user folder and contains a password. Due to password reuse, we can connect to the domain controller as `mhope` using WinRM. Enumeration shows that `Azure AD Connect` is installed. It is possible to extract the credentials for the account that replicates the directory changes to Azure (in this case the default domain administrator).
